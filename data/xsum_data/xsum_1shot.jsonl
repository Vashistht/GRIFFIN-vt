Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}

The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentences.", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}
